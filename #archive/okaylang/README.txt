This lang is okay. It's just okay.

"what do i actually want out of okaylang?"
	i mean - i like clojure! it's just, a lot of things get really hard to express, AND the standard libraries are icky to use, AND it's slow
	i also like python! but, it's slow, AND it doesn't properly have a lot of normal constructs like functional things and macros
	i also like c#! but, it's java-verbose and java-like
	i also like javascript! but, it's slow, and it definitely needs to just be something we compile other stuff to . tho asm.js looks awesome

implemented:
	reader-level indexing[] and function_calls()

would like to implement:
	slicing[:]
	dot.notation
	sexy ways to interact with other code, such as +=
	generators
	better destructuring
	better integrated regex
