		String paper = "Although the American Invitational Mathematics Exam (AIME), a three-hour-long math test of fifteen tough problems, might sound like torture for a lot of people, I enjoyed it because the math was challenging, but not harder than I could handle. Math competition problems usually require one to think considerably more than problems from traditional math curricula so are much more interesting. The path to the AIME began in sixth grade when I was introduced to MathCounts, a competition for sixth through eighth graders. As a home schooled student, I had no experience comparing myself to others and expected to perform poorly at the first Mathcounts Chapter competition. I was stunned to get second place. At State, I had the same expectation—of course to perform poorly. Instead, I tied for first place (but got second by a tie-breaker) and went to Nationals, which was in Detroit. It was thrilling to be among such brilliant math students there. The next year in seventh grade, I thought I had a strong chance to go to Nationals again and so studied extra for it. I chose to take both Algebra II and Geometry and practiced with Mathcounts State and National tests. I did make it to Nationals, placing 98th out of  228, better than my 213th place in the prior year. I had reached the second part of my goal to get the three-year attendee plaque. In three days I’ll reach the third part when I attend Nationals for the third time, this time in Fort Worth, along with three other eighth graders. As I’m seeing the end of Mathcounts competitions, I look forward to working on a new goal: making it to the AIME again and someday the USA Math Olympiad (USAMO). Like my first year at Mathcounts Nationals, I performed poorly on the AIME this year, scoring three out of fifteen. To have advanced to the USAMO, I would have had to have gotten six correct. Worse, on the way home after taking the AIME, I realized I had misread one of the questions that I understood how to solve. Hopefully, I learned the lesson to read problems more carefully—always! What I love most about math competitions is the excitement of trying to win and the satisfaction of puzzling through challenging math problems.";
