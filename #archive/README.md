notes:

figure out where *all* the files that need to be backed up are
if there's a nice api to time machine's current list-of-things-to-be-backed-up that would be excellent
it's tmutil

maybe add ARCHIVE READMEs to all of these? or something like that? and update the old ones, maybe? maybe just make them all READMEs?
