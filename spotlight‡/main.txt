please? can you? i would it would warm the curve of my body

[keyrc ☝☝letter] is nearly the same as [spotlight letter]; it could be enveloped into that system

in general, universal command prediction based on contexts can handle
	* autocompletion
	* goto
	* sublime command palette




subsecond feedback cycles
	[an obvious thing to do in an editor]
	if you type *this* in the editor, it should display as *this*
	*not* as *this* or as this
	and then it displays as this for readers
	but
	in general, existing UIs lack proper subsecond feedback cycles
	except for the best ones, like chrome's omnibar
	this is why terminals failed
	you have to type a command and press enter before seeing anything
	even if it's just a one-letter command, that's still too much time
	(i think. i'm guessing.)
	so the user ends up needing to develop a lot of prediction software inside their head to get anything done
	so you can't do anything smart that would be surprising to the user
	you have to do really predictable autocompletion, for example
