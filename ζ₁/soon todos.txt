okay!
that was extremely interesting.
I really wish we could create interesting things without so much effort.

takeaway from ζ₁:
	we're working with trickier things than json. representing them as json inherently requires additional information.

!! this might not be a dealbreaker





--- super easy, do me next ---
η and ξ need to preserve position information more
add new
the thing where value objects have to be in like {v:} is causing problems with quoting.
implement ~@ quoting
turn create_sexp into as_sexp

---------- less easy ---------
this crude namespacing system _is_ silly.
η/~ really should be η/*
let's add operators, oh gosh!

- right now not next actions -
add SPACE back in
design: φ η ξ should definitely be different programs, but they should also be designed so that we can later transpose the stack.
prolog might be inspiring for operators
