i like this syntax http://www.ocamlpro.com/files/ocaml-lang.pdf

i like this syntax:
foo ← (@,a,b)=>{ ... }
->
foo ← (self,a,b)=>(λ(){ ... }).call(self)

i like this syntax:
operator precedence defaults you can define how you want, but also define
known legible operator precedence
and auto insert parens into the code when the code is not known to be legible

i would like this syntax: […λ*(){ a ← ()=> yield* [5]; a(); }()] = […λ*(){ yield* [5] }()]

i would like a bit more than just syntax here: Stephen Wolfram's Introduction to the Wolfram Language http://youtu.be/_P9HqHVPeik#t=1m02.5s
