```
install:
  brew cask install karabiner
  npm -g i zeta-lang
  npm -g i keyrc
  keyrc start
bonus:
  if you want to remap the power key, install https://github.com/pkamb/PowerKey/issues/39 and set it to the script ~/Documents/keyrc_power_key.sh
```

* will overwrite any existing private.xml (if that doesn't mean anything, don't worry about it)

\#todo remove npm::zeta-lang dependency
