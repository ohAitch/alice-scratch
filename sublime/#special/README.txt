if still on sublime build 3114, Default.sublime-package is a replacement for sublime's builtin (location: /Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/MacOS/Packages)
* removes autocomplete for ' and "
* enables comment syntax definition with a trailing space

if a new sublime version, diff it with Default.sublime-package.bak and merge into the new sublime builtin
