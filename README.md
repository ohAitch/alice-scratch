I've spent a lot of time thinking about efficient language design, and I was inspired by the book CLRS to practice writing its algorithms in a microlisp wrapping LLVM assembly.

This is hard. Too big of a project for spending my summer at hacker school on.

But I have some familiarity with LLVM now!
