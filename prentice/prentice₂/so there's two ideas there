there's autocomplete-terminal
"just like bash except also it has dynamic autocomplete"
but that's silly
the purpose of bash is to be the very complex function that has all the features that it's been depended on to have

it's just
one of the sane things a 

// really i should have been doing this in html 'cause then it at least won't make me relearn guis
// not that it won't try
