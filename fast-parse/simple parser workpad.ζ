word s refer to the procedure-local database of words we know about

parse word s as
re`(.category.re`[LNPMS].`)+` # tip: @device`𐅰𐅩𐅭𐅃𐅃`.ι
except, wordbreak around the below ops and 'filter! map! map… [ ] ( ) { }'.split(' ')

? do this after the other parse steps so that they can reserve their chars

##############################
skip /[ \t]/
except when otherwise stated, skip /\n/

\n
	remember js has ([/+- relevant to ,; and \n
	newline ,; implication?

often we want to separate adjacent objects visually so they are clearly distinct
we generally do this with one of \n , ;
\n and ; are used in contexts where the objects are sideeffecting; , where the objects are values
or |> can be used to pipe a single value

often \n, is used when the separation includes \n s
\n; is not used because javascript lets it be just \n
