#don't-forget it looks like both alignment and indentation are totally redundant
# play some hours with http://scipy.org/getting-started.html. maybe make something with it (http://vetta.org/2008/05/scipy-the-embarrassing-way-to-code/)
# generalized mutation operators (+=, swap!, etc) e.g. something like `(t=f()).string = t.string.toUpperCase()` -> `f().string ??? .toUpperCase()`

# so what *is* up with static typing?
	# * well, it's a type of static annotation so that you can do static analysis
	# * also it's a way of writing programs so that they're extra amenable to static analysis
	# -> but we are guessing that those two things should be replaced with hints and questions
	# * and it's an anti-needless-extra-programming-languages way of eliminating pointless continual redefinition of things which act like types at some layer of abstraction
	# -> now that is an interesting idea. but i think we need experience implementing ✨ before we're ready to implement ✨ with this feature.

-------------------------- list comprehension syntaxes -------------------------
<unsure>
0..100 | Where {$_ * $_ -gt 3} | ForEach {$_ * 2}
var s = from x in Enumerable.Range(0, 100) where x*x > 3 select x*2;

Monad comprehension: In Haskell, a monad comprehension is a generalization of the list comprehension to other monads in functional programming.

do have zip function . else, list comprehensions are sadder
tho in clojure map autozips, kinda?
