# i have always wished there was some good way of doing units, like `16 newtons` or `6 meters` (could not super-smart primitive wrappers do the trick?)
# consider aliasing :: to prototype
# #don't-forget chained comparisons (e.g. a == b == c)
# ruby &:symbol is super cute
# #don't-forget nullsafing
# #don't-forget destructuring includes `[open, contents..., close] =` and `[first, ..., last] =` and you've even got `{name, age, height} =` and also stuff in function calls like `a.b(c...)` <-> `a.b.apply(a,c)`
#don't-forget it looks like both alignment and indentation are totally redundant
# generalized mutation operators (+=, swap!, etc) e.g. something like `(t=f()).string = t.string.toUpperCase()` -> `f().string ??? .toUpperCase()`
# concatenation oughta be * but that is hard because reasons. what about ~ ?
# custom numerical types are awesome. e.g. efficient computation with units, working conveniently with image data in hardware-friendly formats (see: julia)
# play some hours with http://scipy.org/getting-started.html. maybe make something with it (http://vetta.org/2008/05/scipy-the-embarrassing-way-to-code/)
# #old-version---don't-forget-if-it-has-anything-important "separators. which symbols and where should they be. : separatorless style works very well with atomically-delimited style. but the - general problem is that humans need delimiters? or - that the ways we express ourselves in text trip over each other and need delimiting?"

# the true magic of mathematica is that things are handled with term rewriting whenever possible, and that pattern-matching is very good and very well developed, and that the builtin functions are plentiful and well-designed

pattern matching (ocaml?)
	what are the patterns that can be matched?
		are they just json&spreads?
		this would go quite nicely with algebraic datatypes, wouldn't it
			wow, javascript is so imperative
	how can they be matched?
		is it just ordered-choice?
			with ordered-choice, there are also "when" clauses to allow arbitrary logic matches
		also has [a-z]

so what *is* up with static typing?
	* well, it's a type of static annotation so that you can do static analysis
	* also it's a way of writing programs so that they're extra amenable to static analysis
	-> but we are guessing that those two things should be replaced with hints and questions
	* and it's an anti-needless-extra-programming-languages way of eliminating pointless continual redefinition of things which act like types at some layer of abstraction
	-> now that is an interesting idea. but i think we need experience implementing ✨ before we're ready to implement ✨ with this feature.

----- eh - not ready for these yet -----

-------- bah. in-list. -------

i want the word "clique" to be a meaningful macro or smth
copy python-style print sometime: print([object, ...], *, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout)
:keywords slash interned-strings are best enum. but they *need* better typo/wrongness detection (for the sake of fail-fast)

-------------------------- list comprehension syntaxes -------------------------

[for <n> in <c> [while <t>] [if <t>]]

F#
[for x in collection do ... yield expr]

javascript
js> [2*x for each (x in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) if (x*x<5)]
The sequence of integers can be obtained by prototyping the Number object,
Number.prototype.__iterator__=function(){for (var i=0; i<this; i++) yield i}
var s = [2*x for (x in 100) if (x*x<5)]

Perl 6
my @s = ($_ * 2 if $_ ** 2 > 3 for ^100);
my @s = gather { for ^100 { take 2 * $_ if $_ ** 2 > 3 } };

<unsure>
0..100 | Where {$_ * $_ -gt 3} | ForEach {$_ * 2}
var s = from x in Enumerable.Range(0, 100) where x*x > 3 select x*2;

python
S = [2 * x for x in range(101) if x ** 2 > 3]
>>> s = {v for v in 'ABCDABCD' if v not in 'CB'}
>>> s = {key: val for key, val in enumerate('ABCD') if val not in 'CB'}

scala
val s = for (x <- Stream.from(0) if x*x > 3) yield 2*x

Monad comprehension: In Haskell, a monad comprehension is a generalization of the list comprehension to other monads in functional programming.

do have zip function . else, list comprehensions are sadder
tho in clojure map autozips, kinda?
