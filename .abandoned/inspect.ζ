---------------------------- ALGORITHM THOUGHTS TIME ---------------------------
so what weve got here is a simple tree with some fancy formatting

undefined, null, number, boolean, symbol: short!
Boolean, Number: short!
Date: short!
DataView, ArrayBuffer: short!

Promise: short in itself, can contain one child which can be long

string, String: string-list, potentially long
function, RegExp, Error: weird object that can be long but usually isnt
Array, Set, Map, MapIterator, SetIterator, TypedArray, object: list, potentially long

PREFIX LIST_DATA KEYS_DATA SUFFIX

limit: 80Ã—50
walk breadth-first
if something would push us over, skip it and dont come back (for now)
keep going until you only have skipped things left

huh. this is kind of hard! okay, lets think about it later.
