Many Project Euler problems spread out into the triple digits, mostly in C++ with a few in Python as well. Note the twisted, evil macros that bring overloading and optional arguments to the C preprocessor :D

Problem 324 was especially exciting to solve; I've never even thought of using matrix exponentiation for anything before!
